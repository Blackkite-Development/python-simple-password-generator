""" A simple password generator with basic functionality

A simple and easy to use password generator script. The script
has basic functionality, namely a variable password length and the option
to exclude certain groups of characters. The generator only uses the printable
characters from the ASCII table (33-127) and does not depend on any third party libraries.
The password is generated using a SystemRandom to guarantee a more secure password.
